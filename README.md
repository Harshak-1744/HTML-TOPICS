# HTML-TOPICS
Basic HTML topics with challenges 

## Forms
Forms
Overview
HTML forms are essential for collecting user inputs like text, selections (checkboxes, radio buttons), file uploads, etc. They facilitate dynamic interaction between the user and the server.

Key Components
Form Tag (<form>): Encapsulates the entire form, specifying the submission URL (action attribute) and method (GET or POST).
Input Elements (<input>): For different types of data inputs. The type attribute defines the input's nature (text, password, checkbox, etc.).
Textarea (<textarea>): Allows for multi-line text inputs.
Select Menus (<select>): Offers a dropdown list for selection.
Buttons: For submitting the form, resetting fields, or other actions.
How Forms Work
User Interaction: Users fill out and submit the form.
Data Collection: The browser gathers this input data.
Data Submission: The data is sent to the server as defined by the action and method attributes.
Server Processing: The server processes the data and typically responds with new content.
Attributes
Method: GET (appends data to URL, less secure, length limit) or POST (encloses data in the body, more secure, no size limit).
Action: Specifies the server endpoint to receive the form data.
Challenge
Create a simple registration form with fields for a username, password (use <input type="password"> for security), an email address, and a submit button. Use POST as the method.
Import
This section appears incomplete or misplaced. If you meant importing external resources (like CSS or JavaScript) into an HTML document, this involves using the <link> tag for CSS and the <script> tag for JavaScript.

Challenge
Include a CSS file named "style.css" and a JavaScript file named "script.js" into an HTML document.
Elements
HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, defining its structure and content.

Challenge
Create an HTML document that includes the use of paragraphs (<p>), headings (<h1> to <h6>), and an unordered list (<ul>) with three items (<li>).
Attributes
Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements, such as class, id, src, and href.

Challenge
Add custom classes to the elements created in the previous challenge and demonstrate the use of id for a specific element.
Semantics
Semantic HTML introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. It includes elements like <article>, <section>, <nav>, <aside>, and <header>.

Challenge
Structure an HTML document using semantic elements to define a header, main content area with sections, and a footer.
Multimedia
HTML supports multimedia elements such as images (<img>), audio (<audio>), and video (<video>) to embed media in web pages.

Challenge
Embed an image, a video file, and an audio file in an HTML document. Use the controls attribute for video and audio to allow user control.
Block Elements
Block-level elements occupy the full width available, with a new line before and after the element (e.g., <div>, <p>, <h1>).

Challenge
Create a layout with a navigation bar on top using <nav>, a main content section using <section>, and a footer using <footer>. Use <div> elements to organize content within each section.
These topics and challenges cover fundamental aspects of HTML, providing a comprehensive understanding through theory and practical application.
