# HTML-TOPICS
Basic HTML topics with challenges 
 
## Forms
  *Forms* are used to gather the information form the user and send that data to the server. <br>

### **Attributes :-** 

- **`accept`**: Defines the types of files that the server accepts (only for `type="file"`).
- **`accept-charset`**: Specifies the character encodings accepted by the server for form submission.
- **`action`**: Specifies where to send the form data when the form is submitted.
- **`autocomplete`**: Specifies whether the form should have autocomplete on or off.
- **`enctype`**: Defines the content type of the form submission (used when method is "POST").
- **`method`**: Specifies the HTTP method to use when sending form data.
- **`name`**: Specifies the name of the form.
- **`novalidate`**: Indicates the form should not be validated when submitted.
- **`target`**: Specifies where to display the response received after submitting the form.

## Import 
 *Import* in the context of HTML and web development broadly refers to bringing external resources, such as CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, fonts, and multimedia content, into an HTML document.  <br>

## Elements
  In HTML, *elements* are the building blocks of web pages. An element can be a heading, a paragraph, a link, an image, etc. Elements are represented by tags, which can have attributes to provide additional information about the element's content or behavior. <br>


## Attributes
  *Attributes* provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always specified in the start tag (or opening tag) of an element and usually come in name/value pairs like `name="value"`. For example, the `src` attribute of an `img` element specifies the path to the image you want to display. <br>

## Semantics
  *Semantics* in HTML refers to the meaning of the elements and attributes used to build web pages. Semantic HTML uses elements that accurately describe their purpose and content, which helps with accessibility, search engine optimization, and maintainability of the code. Examples of semantic elements include `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<header>`, and `<nav>`. <br>

## Multimedia
*Multimedia* in HTML refers to the incorporation of media content such as images, audio, and video into web pages. This is achieved through elements like `<img>` for images, `<audio>` for audio content, and `<video>` for video content. These elements allow for the embedding of media in web pages, enhancing the user experience with visual and auditory content. <br>

## Block Elements
*Block elements* are HTML elements that typically start on a new line and stretch out as wide as their parent element allows, creating a "block." Examples of block elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>`. They are the foundation for creating the structure and layout of web pages.

## Inline Elements
*Inline elements* are those that do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. This contrasts with block elements, which consume the full width available. Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, and `<img>`. They are often used for small chunks of content within a block-level element.

## Forms and Input
*Forms and Input* elements are used to create forms for user input. This can include text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and submit buttons, among others. Forms are essential for user interaction, allowing users to enter data that can be sent to a server for processing.

## Tables
*Tables* are used to display data in a grid-like format of rows and columns. HTML provides elements such as `<table>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` to create and structure tables. Tables are useful for presenting information in an organized and easy-to-read manner.

## Lists
*Lists* in HTML are used to group a set of related items in a list format. There are three main types of lists in HTML: unordered lists (`<ul>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and description lists (`<dl>`). Each type serves a different purpose, from displaying items without a specific order to showing a list of items in a sequence or a list of terms with their descriptions.

## CSS Integration
*CSS Integration* refers to the methods by which CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is applied to HTML documents to control the presentation of web pages. CSS can be integrated inline, via internal style sheets within a `<style>` element, or through external style sheets linked with the `<link>` element. CSS is crucial for defining the look and feel of web pages, including layout, colors, and fonts.
